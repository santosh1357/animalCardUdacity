				<p class="description">Fish were the first vertebrates with bony skeletons to appear on Earth. Unlike today’s fish, early fish had no scales, fins, or jawbone, but they did have a dorsal fin. 40% of all fish species inhabit fresh water, yet less than .01% of the earth’s water is fresh water. It is estimated that there may still be over 15,000 fish species that have not yet been identified. Fish have been on the earth for more than 450 million years. Fish were well established long before dinosaurs roamed the earth.</p>
